<h1>Balance Sheet API - Finnworlds</h1>

<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/finance-data/balance-sheet-api/">The Balance Sheet API</a> is available through JSON REST API and our databases are also downloadable as an excel or csv file.  We have historical balance sheets in our database from the IPO of all publicly traded companies. Through our API you can request individual components of the balance sheet over the history of a company, or you can request the entire balance sheet based on ticker symbol or ISIN number of a company. The API is very intuitive and easy to use</p>



<p><a href="https://finnworlds.com/">Finnworlds</a>Â Our clients are big enterprises as well as individual developers who use the financial data to develop their platforms without having to worry about maintaining an actual database. We take this worry away so that you can focus on your core business.</p>
